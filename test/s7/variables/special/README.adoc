= dune "special" variables

Listed below. Tests organized in categories:

* file vars: vars referencing specific files, e.g. `%{lib:foolib:bar.mli}`

* pgm vars reference executables: `%{exe:/path/to/mybin}`, `%{bin:mypgm}`, etc.

* everything else


== dune doc

link:https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/concepts.html#variables[dune docs] says:

"In addition, (action ...) fields support the following special variables:"

* `target` expands to the one target.

* `targets` expands to the list of target.

* `deps` expands to the list of dependencies.

* `^` expands to the list of dependencies, separated by spaces.

* `dep:<path>` expands to <path> (and adds <path> as a dependency of the action).

* `exe:<path>` is the same as <path>, except when cross-compiling, in which case it will expand to <path> from the host build context.

* `bin:<program>` expands <path> to program. If program is installed by a workspace package (see install stanzas), the locally built binary will be used, otherwise it will be searched in the <path> of the current build context. Note that (run %{bin:program} ...) and (run program ...) behave in the same way. %{bin:...} is only necessary when you are using (bash ...) or (system ...).

* `bin-available:<program>` expands to true or false, depending on whether <program> is available or not.

* `lib:<public-library-name>:<file>` expands to the file’s installation path <file> in the library <public-library-name>. If <public-library-name> is available in the current workspace, the local file will be used, otherwise the one from the installed world will be used.

* `lib-private:<library-name>:<file>` expands to the file’s build path <file> in the library <library-name>. Both public and private library names are allowed as long as they refer to libraries within the same project.

* `libexec:<public-library-name>:<file>` is the same as lib:..., except when cross-compiling, in which case it will expand to the file from the host build context.

* `libexec-private:<library-name>:<file>` is the same as lib-private:... except when cross-compiling, in which case it will expand to the file from the host build context.

* `lib-available:<library-name>` expands to true or false depending on whether the library is available or not. A library is available if at least one of the following conditions holds:
  ** It’s part the installed world.
  ** It’s available locally and is not optional.
  ** It’s available locally, and all its library dependencies are available.

* `version:<package>` expands to the version of the given package. Packages defined in the current scope have priority over the public packages. Public packages that don’t install any libraries will not be detected. How Dune determines the version of a package is described here.

* `read:<path>` expands to the contents of the given file.

* `read-lines:<path>` expands to the list of lines in the given file.

* `read-strings:<path>` expands to the list of lines in the given file, unescaped using OCaml lexical
